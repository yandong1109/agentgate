# AgentGate

AgentGate is an open-source evaluation harness for enterprise agents.

It helps teams run agent test cases, collect traces, evaluate behavior, compare versions, and make release gate decisions.

## Goal

AgentGate focuses on:

- Active evaluation: run cases against an agent.
- Passive evaluation: score existing production traces.
- Business contracts: validate tool calls, arguments, policies, workflow rules, and final state.
- Release gates: decide whether an agent/model/prompt version is safe to ship.
- Dataset growth: turn failures and traces into regression cases.

## Initial Architecture

CLI / Web / REST API

    Control Layer
        |
Case -> Run -> Trace -> Evaluator -> Result
```

## Project Layout

```text
src/agentgate/
  case/          # Cases, datasets, custom/public benchmark import
  run/           # Run engine, targets, lifecycle
  trace/         # Trace model, OTel import, execution graph
  evaluator/     # Built-in and external evaluators
  result/        # Results, reports, compare, release gates
  experiment/    # Controlled A/B experiments and statistical decisions
  queue/         # Public reservation and queue orchestration
  optimizer/     # Badcase analysis and human-reviewed recommendations
  lineage/       # Asset versions and dependency lineage
  control_plane/ # Local control-plane service used by CLI/API/Web
  cli/           # Command-line entry point
  server/        # REST API entry point

web/             # Vue/TypeScript evaluation UI
docs/            # Design docs
examples/        # Demo agents and datasets
tests/           # Test suite
```

The five core evaluation objects remain `Case -> Run + Trace -> Evaluator -> Result`.
Experiment, queue, optimizer, and lineage are product modules composed around that core;
they do not replace it. See the [documentation index](docs/README.md) and individual
module design records for verified capability ownership and progress.

## First Demo Target

The first demo should be a loan approval agent:

- The agent may create a loan application.
- The agent must not approve high-risk loans directly.
- Approval may require human review.
- Evaluators check tool calls, tool arguments, workflow policy, and final state.

## P1 Demo

The repository contains a working SQLite-backed loan-approval evaluation slice with a
deterministic target, HTTP External Target support, CLI, REST/OTLP HTTP endpoints, and a
Chinese Vue UI. Current status is maintained in the relevant Trace, Run, Dataset, and
Evaluator documents. The original P1 walkthrough is retained under
[history](docs/history/p1-demo/demo-test-guide.md).

Published Dataset versions can be exported as JSON or Excel. Excel imports create a new
Dataset Draft and support single-turn and multi-turn Cases. See the
[Dataset documentation](docs/dataset/README.md) for the workbook contract and limits.
