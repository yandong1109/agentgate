# AgentGate Documentation

## Current Authority

- [Product requirements](product-requirements-zh.md) define the intended product behavior.
- [Requirements baseline](requirements-baseline-zh.md) is the detailed, authoritative
  statement of requirements (numbering, priorities, acceptance criteria), supplementing the
  product requirements overview; where the two differ, the baseline prevails.
- [Architecture review ledger](architecture-review-ledger.md) is the authoritative
  `refactor-1` structure while Level 2 and Level 3 review is in progress.
- Running code and automated tests describe the inherited `goal/p1-demo` baseline; they
  do not override confirmed refactor decisions in the ledger.

The consolidated `arch.md`, implementation roadmap, and capability mapping will be
regenerated after the architecture review is complete.

## Current Module Documents

| Capability | Documentation | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dataset and Case | [dataset/](dataset/) | Reusable loading, formats, versioning, sampling, and generation mechanics |
| Evaluator | [evaluator/](evaluator/) | Rule, LLM Judge, Hybrid, and evaluator execution |
| Static analysis | [analysis/](analysis/) | Agent/Skill definition conflict, confusion, and Prompt alignment analysis |
| Run | [run/](run/) | Run manifests, execution engine, process management, retry, and artifacts |
| Trace | [trace/](trace/) | Canonical Trace normalization and redaction |
| Result | [result/](result/) | Metrics, gates, reports, and Run comparison |
| Control panel | [control-panel/](control-panel/) | Vue Web UI and user workflows |

Cross-capability orchestration belongs in `application/`. External systems are connected
through `integrations/`. Persistence implementations belong in `storage/`.

## Plan Status

Detailed implementation plans that carry a pre-refactor warning retain useful behavior,
contracts, and acceptance criteria, but their file maps are not authoritative. Update
them against the ledger before implementation.

Historical P1 and earlier planning records are under [history/](history/).
